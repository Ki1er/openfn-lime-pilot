# OpenFn Prototype for MSF LIME Project

Automating data exchange workflows between `DHIS2`, `OpenMRS`, and `OC`L. 

*Note that commits to `main` will be auto-deployed to OpenFn.org. Always work on a branch!*

## Working with the Repo

1. Clone the repo to work with it locally
2. Locally create `/tmp` folder locally with a `state.json` file that you don't commit to github
3. start writing and testing jobs locally with the relevant adaptor
